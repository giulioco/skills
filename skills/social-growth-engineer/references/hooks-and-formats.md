## Content Testing Framework

### Hook A/B Testing Process

**Test Variables**:
1. Same actor, consistent format
2. Change ONLY the hook text
3. Post 10 different hook variations
4. Track: Views, engagement rate, "what's the app?" comments

**After 30 Videos**:
- Identify 3x median performer
- Make 30 more variations of that winning hook
- Test format variations while keeping hook
- Find new 3x performer
- Repeat cycle

### Format Performance Metrics

**Good Format Indicators**:
- High bookmark/save rate
- "What's the app?" comments
- Completion rate >50%
- 3x median views achieved

**Bad Format Indicators**:
- Low engagement despite views
- No question comments
- <30% completion rate
- Flat median across many videos

### Iteration Strategy

**Phase 1: Format Testing** (Videos 1-30)
- Try 5-10 different formats
- Same hook across formats
- Find what resonates

**Phase 2: Hook Testing** (Videos 31-60)
- Winning format from Phase 1
- 10+ different hooks
- Find 3x performer

**Phase 3: Scale** (Videos 61+)
- Winning format + winning hook
- Make 30+ variations
- Add to multiple accounts
- Geographic/language variants
