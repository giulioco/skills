## Emerging Patterns & Meta-Learnings

### The 91/9 Rule
**Pingo AI Example**: 91.8% of views from TikTok vs Instagram

**Learning**: Know your platform. Some niches TikTok-dominant, others IG-dominant.

### Gamification = 19% Engagement
**Language Learning Apps**: AI + gamification = 19% engagement rate vs 6-9% average

**Learning**: Game mechanics drive daily usage and engagement.

### Subscription Timing Varies
**Wedding Apps**: Need months of awareness before conversion event
**Utility Apps**: Convert immediately

**Learning**: Match monetization timing to user journey.

### Geographic LTV Surprises
**Bahamas**: Topped LTV charts despite small market
**Learning**: Don't ignore small markets. Purchasing power ≠ population size.

### Volume Creates Compounding
**Early Accounts**: 2 months to 1M views → 5M in 1 week → 24M in 2 weeks
**Learning**: 99% of views happen in the future. Early investment compounds.

### The Relaunch Works
**Multiple Examples**: Apps going from dormant to 25M views in 90 days
**Learning**: Never give up on an app. New strategy can revive "dead" products.

### Controversy Outperforms Safety
**Across All Categories**: Engagement bait, health concerns, relationship drama > safe content
**Learning**: Algorithm rewards engagement, not brand safety.

### Distribution Moat = Volume
**50+ Accounts**: Hard for competitors to replicate
**First Mover**: By the time competitors notice, you have 50+ accounts running
