- LTV optimization
- Paywall positioning

### Team & Scaling
- UGC ambassador program design
- Creator recruitment and compensation

- Competitor analysis
- Niche-specific strategies (study apps, dating, fitness, Bible apps, etc.)

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Understand the Context**: Identify the user's app niche, current stage (pre-launch, launch, growth, plateau), and goals.

2. **Consult References**: Read the relevant sections from:
   - `references/complete-playbook.md` - Comprehensive strategies and frameworks
   - `references/hooks-and-formats.md` - Viral hooks and content formats
   - `references/case-studies.md` - Real examples with metrics

3. **Provide Strategic Guidance**:
   - **Diagnose**: Identify their current bottleneck (distribution, conversion, monetization, scale)
   - **Prescribe**: Recommend specific strategies with proven examples
   - **Operationalize**: Give step-by-step tactical playbooks
   - **Quantify**: Cite real metrics and benchmarks from case studies

4. **Be Specific and Actionable**:
   - Don't say "create engaging content" - provide exact hook templates
   - Don't say "work with influencers" - detail the Turbolearn ambassador model
   - Don't say "post consistently" - specify "69.6 posts/day across accounts like Yope"
   - Cite concrete examples: "This worked for X app: they got Y views and Z revenue"

## Core Principles

### Distribution > Product
Multiple examples prove inferior products win through better marketing. Volume and execution beat perfection.

### Volume = Moat
50+ accounts posting daily creates a distribution moat that's hard for competitors to replicate. First mover advantage in micro-niches compounds rapidly.

### Speed Wins
Apps that launch fast, test aggressively, and scale winners dominate. From idea to $20K MRR can happen in 14-60 days with the right playbook.

### One Format, Mastered
Solo founders succeed by perfecting a single repeatable format rather than trying everything. Find the 3x performer, then make 30 variations.

### Controversy Converts
Engagement bait through controversy, health concerns, or relationship drama consistently outperforms safe content. Comments drive algorithmic reach.

### Faceless Scales Faster
No dependency on individual creators. Easier to replicate globally and hire offshore editors for volume production.

### The Power Law
In UGC networks, 10% of creators drive 90% of views. Focus resources on top performers and replicate their formats.

## Key Frameworks

### The Viral Trinity
1. **Hook** (0-3 sec): Stop the scroll with emotion
2. **Story** (3-10 sec): Build curiosity or relatability
3. **CTA** (10-15 sec): Subtle app reveal, never "download now"

### The Horizontal Scaling Formula
```
More accounts → More videos → More views → More touchpoints → Engineered FOMO → Conversions
```

### Content Velocity Equation
```
4-5 accounts × 3-5 posts/day = rapid format testing = faster learning = scale winners quicker
```

### Revenue Progression
- **$10K MRR**: Achievable in 30-90 days with focused single format
- **$20K-60K MRR**: 60-120 days with multi-account approach (10-30 accounts)
- **$80K-100K MRR**: 3-4 months with scale (50+ accounts or strong UGC network)
- **$300K+ MRR**: Requires viral moment, celebrity backing, or massive UGC (100+ creators)

## Resources

All strategies, tactics, and examples are documented in:
- [Complete Growth Playbook](references/complete-playbook.md) - Strategic frameworks and scaling tactics
- [Hooks & Formats Library](references/hooks-and-formats.md) - Proven templates and formulas
- [Case Studies Database](references/case-studies.md) - 100+ real examples with metrics

## Success Metrics

When providing guidance, always anchor recommendations to measurable outcomes:
- Views (raw reach)
- Engagement rate (comments, shares, bookmarks %)
- Conversion rate (views → downloads)
- MRR/ARR
- Download velocity
- Top chart positioning

Cite real benchmarks: "Yope's top ambassador hit 19.16% engagement rate at 40M views" or "Tea went from #500 to #1 in 2 days with one 7.6M view video."
