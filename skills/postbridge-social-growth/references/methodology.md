## Phase 1: Account Creation (Day 1)

Create brand new TikTok and Instagram accounts. Do NOT use existing accounts with irrelevant history.

### Bio Strategy

Bio must answer: **"What do you offer, and how can I get it?"**

- Align bio with content focus
- Clearly communicate the offering
- Drive viewers toward product/app

**TikTok**: Type URL or app name directly in bio (links unavailable until follower threshold).
**Instagram**: Use business/creator account for link functionality. Use app store links or website URL.

### Account Creation Checklist

- Create ONE TikTok account
- Create ONE Instagram account
- Write conversion-optimized bio

## Phase 2: Account Warmup (Days 2-8)

**CRITICAL: DO NOT POST FOR 7 DAYS.**

Skipping warmup = algorithm buries content. This is the #1 reason new accounts get zero views.

### Why Warmup Works

- Algorithm needs to understand your niche before you publish
- Initial engagement signals determine which audience sees your content
- Skipping warmup triggers bot flags (0-100 views per post)
- 7 days is the safest duration; 3 days sometimes works but risks restart

### Daily Protocol (15 mins/day per platform)

1. **Scroll in niche** - Watch content exclusively related to your app/niche
2. **Engage naturally** - Follow relevant accounts, watch videos fully, like posts, leave genuine comments
3. **Save viral content** - Bookmark videos with 100K+ views or 1K+ likes suitable for recreation
4. **NO POSTING** - Zero posts until warmup complete

### Daily Breakdown

- **Day 2**: 15-minute scrolling + commenting, replies, following
- **Day 3**: Repeat Day 2
- **Days 4-8**: Repeat + save 3-5 recreatable videos daily

**Goal**: 15-25 saved viral videos as content templates.

### Posting Method Rule

Post through the **mobile app** for first 10 posts. No web interfaces or third-party tools. Algorithm verifies authenticity through native app posting.

## Phase 3: Content Market Fit (Days 8-30)

Find your **winning format** - content that consistently gets 1,000+ views and comments from ideal customers.

### Core Strategy: Remake What Already Works

Do NOT create original content from scratch. Remake saved viral videos, adapting formats to your niche. Expect 100+ attempts before finding a winning format (guide author needed 300+).

### Production Steps

1. Download CapCut (free video editor)
2. Extract audio from saved viral videos ("TikTok to MP3" / "Reel to MP3")
3. Recreate format: maintain hook and structure, change content to your niche
4. Optimize for watch time and comments

### Two Metrics That Matter

1. **Watch Time** - Hook viewers in first 3 seconds. Maximize completion rates.
2. **Comments** - Create discussion-worthy content that encourages interaction.

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Strategy

Every video must include a CTA:
- Mention business in video captions
- Pin a first comment with CTA
- Feature app in video content (prominently or subtly in background)

**Golden rule: Do NOT make videos that look like ads.** Educate, entertain, or emotionally connect.

### Posting Cadence

- **One video per day** during testing phase
- Quality over quantity until a winning format emerges
- When a format consistently hits 1,000+ views, create variations
- Abandon underperforming formats

### What NOT To Do

- Post 5-6 videos daily before finding what works
- Create obviously promotional content
- Give up after only 10 videos (commit to 100+ attempts)
- Skip the CTA

## Phase 4: Riding Trends (Ongoing)

Trends = popular sounds, formats, or topics the algorithm actively pushes. Adapting them to your niche provides extra reach.

### How to Spot Trends

Look for sounds/formats with **10K-50K uses** (growing but not oversaturated).

### Execution

1. Adapt trending format to your niche **within 24-48 hours**
2. Post alongside regular content (don't replace proven formats)
3. Monitor reach vs. regular posts

### Content Mix

- Most content: **evergreen** proven formats
- 1-2 trend posts per week
- Optionally combine proven formats with trending sounds

### Technical Tip

Download trending audio directly - platforms recognize it regardless of sourcing method.

---

## Phase 5: Views to Customers (Ongoing)

### Conversion Funnel

```
Video → Profile → Bio → Landing Page → Download → Active User
```

### What Works

1. **Problem-focused content** - Address problems your app solves, mention it as the solution
2. **Show, don't tell** - Screen recordings, before/after results, app in background casually
3. **Direct mention** - Include what your business does in captions and bio
4. **Strategic comment replies** - Answer helpfully, naturally reference app, reply to early comments on cold accounts

### Conversion Mistakes

- Making obvious sales pitches
- Using generic CTAs ("Download my app: [name]")
- Expecting immediate conversions (build trust through repeated exposure)
- Ignoring comments (every unanswered comment = missed engagement + reach)

---

## Phase 6: Scaling System (Days 30+)

### Readiness Milestones (ALL required before scaling)

- 30+ days of consistent posting
- At least one video with 100K+ views (or multiple with 10K+)
- 2-3 proven content formats
- Demonstrable downloads/conversions from content

> **Scaling 0 views x 10 accounts = still 0 views.**

### Three-Phase Scaling

**Phase A: Main Account Intensification (Days 30-45)**
- Increase to 2-3 daily posts
- Space posts 3-4 hours apart
- Combine proven formats with trending content

**Phase B: Secondary Account Launch (Days 45-60)**
- Create account #2 on same platform
- Execute complete 7-day warmup (no shortcuts)
- Post proven content across both accounts (4-6 daily total)

**Phase C: Cross-Platform Expansion (Days 60+)**
Distribute winning content to: Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook.

### Scaling Math

| Setup | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1 account, 1 post/day | ~100 downloads/day |
| 2 accounts, 3 posts each/day | ~600 downloads/day |
| 4 accounts across TikTok + Instagram | 30,000+ downloads/30 days |

## Critical Rules

**Non-negotiable:**
1. ALWAYS execute 7-day warmup before posting on any new account
2. ALWAYS post manually from mobile app for first 10 posts per account
3. NEVER use automation on accounts averaging less than 500 views/video
4. NEVER repost identical videos on same platform (unless months later with significant changes)

Breaking these rules = shadowbanned accounts with 0 views.
